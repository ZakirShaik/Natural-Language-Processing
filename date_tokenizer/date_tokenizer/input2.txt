He sometimes pondered the events of his life, looking at things in a different light each time.
How differently things would have been for him if his parents, then unmarried, had
not met on the long voyage across the Atlantic.
Their passports said they arrived the 12th of August, 1914, 90 years ago.

They trekked from Newfoundland to his uncles cabin in Minnesota, arriving on a cold November 21st that same year.
As a matter of coincidence, they married almost exactly one year later, on the 11th of November 1915.
It surprised him that his parents never spoke of their trans-Atlantic adventure, as if it were as normal as a visit with neighbors.
What was miraculous to them was his late-night arrival on April 14, 1917.
He was their first and only child, and as such was the center of life for them.
He was doted upon in a manner which was unnatural for the time.
He enjoyed the attention and unending stream of affection.
Their life was so different than today, but in some ways similar.
They had a small, two bedroom cabin, no larger than the apartment his son moved him to July 24,
2002.
The main mode of transportation was by foot, as his has been since relinquishing his drivers license the 11th of April, 3 days before his 87th birthday.

He recalls with joy the first car his father purchased.
It was the 29th of March 1927, and the automobile was the much more stylish Chevrolet, costing just $200 more than a Model T.
They were one of the first families on the Range to get a car, with the exception of the mine managers and commercial vehicles like the dairy truck and the Hupmoble, which was the beginning of the Greyhound bus line, used to transport miners to the pit.

His mind wandered to his young boy fascination of all forms of transport, and how he sought out any and all stories of flight.
Remembering Lindberghs success on that early May 20th morning of 1927, he saw the pictures in his mind of the barnstormers who occasionally came through the area.
In fact, it was during one of those visits, the 7th of August, 1930, when he met the girl he was to marry, although he didnt know it at the time.

His family did not feel the depression much, at least it did not impact their daily lives as it did many others.
It was still fairly easy for a hard working young man to find work, and from the 15th of May to the 15th of September (during his school break) of every year he worked at nearby farms. This continued through his 15th year.

It was then, May 2, 1933, he caught the lucky break of getting a part-time job at the mine.
The product of the open-pit, iron ore mines was in high demand, and US Steel needed all able bodied men to keep the shovels running.
If the farms were the heart, the mines were the backbone of the Range.
Despite the dangerous nature of the work, the non-unionized positions were coveted, even after the Hibbing North 40 relocation on July 7th, 1910.
He had his eye on the big shovels, and spent hours with the seasoned operators.
They liked the eager young man, who could already hold his liquor with the best of them, and when an old-timer retired on the 1st of August, opening a slot for a driver, he was thrilled the close-knit senior group got him the position.
He did not go back to school September 3rd of that year.
He had only completed through the 10th grade, but had one of the best paying positions in the mine, and didnt feel he could do any better by finishing high school.
He thought now, September 14, 2004, 71 years later, how easily he could still recite The Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner, as if he had learned it yesterday.
During the next few years, he had a good time, basking in his perceived wealth, and courting his future wife, whom he married on the 10th of November 1939.
She was the youngest child of Finnish dairy farmers, and he had a lot of convincing to do, in order to procure her parents agreement to their engagement.
He worked a full time job at the mineoften 12 hour shifts through the middle of the cold, Minnesota winter nights, and then a full days work at the Ollila farm.
She was expected to take over the expansive dairy, but had plans to the contrary.

They purchased a home in the model city of Calumet on January 9th, 1942; and their son was born October 29th of 43.
His mother had the up stairs apartment in the home, and although it suited him fine, he chuckled as he remembered the fights between his new wife and mother, then saddened as he recalled her passing on July 17, 1968.
They worked hard and played hard for the next sever al years, enjoying life on the growing Range and visiting all areas of the country.
Their only son married the 4th of September, 1961, and was quite busy making memories of his own, but thats someone elses story.

Dates in article body text should all use the same format: She fell ill on 25 June 2005 and died on 28 June, but not She fell ill on 25 June 2005 and died on June 28.
Publication dates in an article's citations should all use the same format, which may be:
the format used in the article body text,
an abbreviated format from the "Acceptable date formats" table, provided the day and month elements are in the same order as in dates in the article body, or
the format expected in the citation style being used (however, all-numeric date formats other than yyyy-mm-dd must still be avoided).
For example, publication dates within a single article might be in one, but only one, of these formats (among others):
Jones, J. (20 September 2008)
Jones, J. (September 20, 2008)
Access and archive dates in an article's citations should all use the same format, which may be:
the format used for publication dates in the article;
the format expected in the citation style adopted in the article (e.g. 20 Sep 2008); or
yyyy-mm-dd
For example, access/archive dates within a single article might be in one, but only one, of these formats (among others):
Jones, J. (September 20, 2008) ... Retrieved February 5, 2009.
Jones, J. (20 Sep 2008) ... Retrieved 5 Feb 2009.
Jones, J. (20 September 2008) ... Retrieved 2009-02-05.
When a citation style does not expect differing date formats, it is permissible to normalize publication dates to the article body text date format, and/or access/archive dates to either, with date consistency being preferred.
Articles on topics with strong ties to a particular English-speaking country should generally use the date format most commonly used in that nation. For the United States this is (for example) July 4, 1976; for most other English-speaking countries it is 4 July 1976
In general, do not use CE or AD unless required to avoid ambiguity (e.g. The Norman Conquest took place in 1066 not 1066 CE nor AD 1066) or awkwardness (January 1, 1 AD not January 1, 1). On the other hand, Plotinus lived at the end of the 3rd century AD will avoid confusion, and depending on context one- and two-digit years may look more natural with an era marker (born in 2 AD). Also, in He did not become king until 55 CE the era marker makes it clear that 55 does not refer to the new king's age (or write He did not become king until the year 55). If the era is shown for the initial date in a range, then use it for the final date as well: not from 450 BCE to 200 but from 450 to 200 BCE or from 450 BCE to 200 BCE (and definitely from 100 BCE to 200 CE)
A date can be given in any appropriate calendar, as long as it is (at the minimum) given in the Julian calendar or the Gregorian calendar or both, as described below. For example, an article on the early history of Islam may give dates in both Islamic and Julian calendars. Where a calendar other than the Julian or Gregorian is used, the article must make this clear.
Current events are dated using the Gregorian calendar.
Dates of events in countries using the Gregorian calendar at that time are given in the Gregorian calendar. This includes some of the Continent of Europe from 1582, the British Empire from 14 September 1752, and Russia from 14 February 1918 (see Adoption of the Gregorian calendar).
Dates before 15 October 1582 (when the Gregorian calendar was first adopted in some places) are normally given in the Julian calendar. The Julian day and month should not be converted to the Gregorian calendar, but the start of the Julian year should be assumed to be 1 January (see below for more details).
Dates for Roman history before 45 BC are given in the Roman calendar, which was neither Julian nor Gregorian. When (rarely) the Julian equivalent is certain, it may be included.
For dates in early Egyptian and Mesopotamian history, Julian or Gregorian equivalents are often uncertain. Follow the consensus of reliable sources, or indicate their divergence.
The dating method used should follow that used by reliable secondary sources (or if reliable sources disagree, that used most commonly, with an explanatory footnote).
At some places and times, the new year began on a date other than 1 January. For example, in England and its colonies until 1752, the year began on Annunciation Day, 25 March; see the New Year article for other styles. In writing about historical events, however, years should be assumed to have begun on 1 January (see the example of the execution of Charles I in "Differences in the start of the year"); if there is reason to use another start-of-year date, this should be noted.

Note: A change from a preference for two digits, to a preference for four digits, on the right side of year–year ranges was implemented in July 2016 per this RFC.
Use a dash, or a word such as from or between, but not both: from 1881 to 1886 (not from 1881-1886). 

Will it be between June 1 and July 3. 
Not between June 1 - July 3.
A simple year–year range is written using an en dash (&ndash; or {{ndash}}) not a hyphen or slash; this dash is usually unspaced (that is, with no space on either side); and the range's end year is usually given in full. The dates are as follows  1881-1886.  1881-1992. not 1881-86.  1881 - 1992.
Markup: 1881{{ndash}}1886 or 1881&ndash;1886
Two-digit ending years (1881–82, but never 1881–882 or 1881–2) may be used in any of the following cases: (1) two consecutive years; (2) infoboxes and tables where space is limited (using a single format consistently in any given table column); and (3) in certain topic areas if there is a very good reason, such as matching the established convention of reliable sources.
The slash notation (2005/2006) may be used to signify a fiscal year or other special period, if that convention is used in reliable sources.
Other "simple" ranges use an unspaced en dash as well.
Day–day: 5-7 January 1979.
And also January 5-7, 1979.

March 5th - 8th.
The 1940 peak period was May-July.
The peak period was May-July 1940.
But the peak period was May 1940 - July 1940 uses a spaced en dash.

For a person still living: Serena Williams (born September 26, 1981) is a ..., not (September 26, 1981 – ) or (born on September 26, 1981).
Do not use * to indicate born; use b. only where space is limited e.g. tables and infoboxes; use either born or b. consistently in any given table column.
Where birthdate is unknown: John Smith (died May 1, 1622) or John Smith (died 1622)
Do not use † to indicate died; use d. only where space is limited, with consistency within any given table column.
An overnight period may be expressed using a slash between two contiguous dates: the night raids of 30/31 May 1942 or raids of 31 May 1942.
Or use an en dash: (unspaced) raids of 30-31 May 1942;  (spaced) raids of 31 May - 1 June 1942.
The {{Age}} template can keep ages current in infoboxes and so on:
  •  {{age|1989|7|23}} returns: 28
  •  {{age|1989|7|23}}-year-old returns: 28-year-old
  •  {{age|1989|7|23}} years old returns: 28 years old
Date mathematics templates are available for other age calculations.

Seasons are uncapitalized (a hot summer) except when personified: Old Man Winter's bleak greys relent as Spring begins to show her colors.
Using seasons to refer to a particular time of year (winter 1995) is ambiguous for two reasons:
the same names are used for both northern hemisphere and southern hemisphere seasons, which occur six months apart, and;
areas near the equator have only wet and dry seasons.
Unambiguous alternatives include early 1995;  the first quarter of 1995;  January to March 1995;  spent the southern summer in Antarctica.
Referring to a season by name is appropriate when it is part of a formal or conventional name or designation (annual mid-winter festival;  the autumn harvest;  2018 Winter Olympics;  Times Fall Books Supplement;  Details appeared in Quarterly Review, Summer 2015;  The Court's winter term).
